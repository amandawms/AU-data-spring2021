# Congress: Dog People or Cat People? 

I want to know if more members of Congress have pet dogs, pet cats, neither or both. Americans put a lot of stock in pet ownership and what it says about people, and the voters should know if their representative is a cat person or a dog person.

I would want to know if the official has a dog or cat and many of each, and which party the official belongs to. 

To collect the data, I would start by scouring congressional social media accounts because those often feature pictures of pets, then I would confirm the final tally with each elected official's office. 

Title | Name | Party | Num. Cats | Num. Dogs | Num. Neither  
----- | ---- | ----- | --------- | --------- | ------------ 
Senator | Rafael Warnock | D | 0 | 1 | 0
Senator | Elizabeth Warren | D | 0 | 1 | 0
Representative | Glenn Grothman | R | 0 | 1 | 0
Senator | Maise Hirono | D | 1 | 0 |  0
Senator | Deb Fischer | R | 0 | 1 | 0
