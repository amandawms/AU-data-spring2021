[Texas Tribune: Advocates worry vaccines will be out of reach for Black and Hispanic neighborhoods devastated by COVID-19](https://www.texastribune.org/2021/01/09/texas-coronavirus-vaccine-racial-inequality/) 

### Clarity and accuracy

  * 5 - The reporters clearly laid out the theme of the story and the driving question in the lede and the headline. The headline tells you that there's a racial dispartity in COVID-19 death rates that may also be reflected in vaccination rates, and lede adds to that idea by saying why â€“- it's due to the location of vaccination sites. 
  * 5 - There were four maps used to demonstrate the article's main point, which makes sense because the vaccination problem is location-based. The coloring was clearly explained in a key as way the symbol to represent various vaccination sites. I navigated the visualization by first noticing the differnces in color across the maps, which represented different concentrations of people by race, and then I noticed the concentrations of dots in the primarily blue (and therefore higher white population) areas. It could have been nice to pull out the cities from the counties, since there's clear population density in the cities that make the map harder to read. 
  * 4 - I think it was accurate, though there is a note at the top that the data is slightly outdated now. 
  * List any areas where you question the accuracy of the data.
    1. I would look more closely at rural vs. urban areas because since the visualization is a map, it inherently shows land as people. 
    2. I would also want to figure out a way to communicate the difference in population density within the counties. 
  * List sources you would suggest the reporter check with. 
    1. I think they checked the two I would go to, the Census Bureau and the state health services. It's possible the CDC could also have useful information. 
  * Did they provide a source? yes - Texas Department of State Health Services, Census Bureau
  * Did they explain everything that needed explaining? I think so. In the article they go more into the differences between minority races than the graphics are able to show. 

### Quality

  * Regardless of the form that the graphic/story takes, was it executed at a high degree of quality? (Rank 1-5, with five excellent.)
    * 5 - The reporters did a good job of communicating the point using data, visualiztions and a personal story to show the impact of the varied vaccination sites. The article was also solutions-based, and talked about what localities were doing to try to address the disparities. The article notes that the disparity is partly because there's just more infrastructure of hospitals, clinics, pharmacies etc in the the majority-white areas of the counties, which means more vaccination sites. The article does not get into the systemic disparties present as much, though they are mentioned.  

### Type and color (if piece includes graphics)

  * Based on your knowledge of color and type use, did this person use type (as in typography, fonts) and color to their best purpose?
The layout was well executed, I liked seeing all four counties shown side-by-side for easy comparison. The differennt colors, representing race of population, did draw my eye first and I did think it made sense, though the choice of color to represent race was interesting (orange and blue).  

Type (1-5) | Color (1-5) 
-----|------
5 - I thought it all looked cohesive. | 4 - The orange and blue colors threw me off a bit, but I can understand why they chose such opposing colors to clearly demonstrate the differences.   

### Creativity

  * Did the piece use some creative elements to good effect? As in, to emphasize those areas that could draw someone in, or to add detail where needed, but not just random visual or story junk that distracts you?
    * 5 - I love maps and I thought this was a good article for them. The story was geographically-based, and the maps also allowed for clear demarcation of populations by race. Because they chose to highlight four different Texas counties, it was easy to compare various localities on the same metrics. I think it paid off because while three of the four counties had this major disparity of vaccination sites clearly laid out, the third was more evenly spread across populations. 


# Pitch 

I think we should investigate disparities in bank lending across D.C. to find out where the most money goes for residential loans and if there is a dispartity across neighborhoods by race (Georgetown vs. Anacostia, for example). We could use Home Mortgage Disclosure Act Data from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Census Bureau data to overlay the lending with neighborhoods by race. This is timely now because with low interest rates and high mobilty, more people are buying and selling houses right now than a normal year, but I wonder who's benefiting most from this seemingly favorable house-buying market. I would talk to anyone currently looking to buy and house and is going through the lender approval process, and/or someone who did buy or try to buy a house in different neighborhoods in the last year. The second part of this story is, if banks lend less in majority non-white neighborhoods, why might that be? and the answer might have to do with appraisals of property in different neighborhoods leading to differing lending practices. I'm not sure if there's data that could get us to answering that question, but it's an undercurrent to why banks tend to lend less money in majority non-white neighborhoods. [This pitch was inspired by WBEZ doing exactly this for Chicago.](https://interactive.wbez.org/2020/banking/disparity/)
